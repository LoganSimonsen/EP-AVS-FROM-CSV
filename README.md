# EP-AVS-FROM-CSV
An example of how you can loop through addresses on a CSV file and verify them against the EasyPost Address Verification Service

Make sure to replace 'YOUR_EASYPOST_API_KEY' with your actual EasyPost API key and 'your_file.csv' with the path to your CSV file. Note that EasyPost may charge for address verification requests, so make sure to check their pricing and terms of use.

Also, note that this script assumes a valid CSV format with headers (name, street1, street2, city, state, zip, country). Adjust the column names in the script if your CSV file has different headers.
